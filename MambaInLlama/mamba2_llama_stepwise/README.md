This is to show how stepwise distillation works.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
    <img src="../assets/stepwise.png" alt="MambaInLlama" style="width:100%;">
</div>

Run `bash stepwise.sh`

If you are only interested in non-attention model instead of hybrid model, we suggest you switch from the first layer to last layer with a stepwise manner.
